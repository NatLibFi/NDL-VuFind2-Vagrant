Files to put in this directory:
1) Oracle Instant Client packages
2) Voyager holdings information configurations
3) tnsnames.ora for Oracle sqlplus users (ubuntu only)

---

1)
To be able to access holdings information from Voyager systems dowload
the Oracle Instant Client packages for Linux x86-64 from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html
and put them into this directory before privisioning the virtual machine.

The files needed are Basic and SDK:
- Ubuntu
	instantclient-basic-linux.x64-x.x.x.x.x.zip
	instantclient-sdk-linux.x64-x.x.x.x.x.zip
- CentOS
	oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-x.x.x.x.x-x.x86_64.rpm
	oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-x.x.x.x.x-x.x86_64.rpm

2)
If you have the Voyager holdings information configuration file(s) with correct
credentials and settings, you can put the file(s) here and it/they will be
copied inside the virtual machine during the provisiong. Also, the
MultiBackend.ini file will be modified based on the file name(s).
 
The file name(s) should follow the pattern 'VoyagerRestful_orgname.ini'.
Some examples:
    - VoyagerResful_jykdok.ini,
    - VoyagerRestful_helka.ini or
    - VoyagerRestful_oula.ini

Alternatively you can copy the file(s) manually to
'vufind2/local/config/vufind/' and adjust the MultiBackend.ini in
'vufind2/local/config/finna' directory.

3)
If using sqlplus, you can include your own tnsnames.ora file in the virtual
machine by placing it in this directory. The file can also be placed into
'/opt/oracle/instantclient_xx_x/' directory in the guest afterwards.
